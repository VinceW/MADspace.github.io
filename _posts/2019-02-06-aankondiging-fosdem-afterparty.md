# Aankondiging FOSDEM afterparty 2019-02-06

Dear hackers,

With a group we went to FOSDEM, the biggest Open Source conference in Europe [FOSDEM](https://www.fosdem.org). 

A weekend filled with the coolest talks on Open Source. 

On Wednesday 2019-02-06 we share our findings and highlights of this conference! 

Join us this evening and enjoy our memories about this great hackerweekend!
