<h2>Aankondiging - Hacking Challenges (2019-07-31)</h2>

Security skills are in high demand! As the world continues to turn everything into devices on the internet, the demand is only growing, so let's learn hacking! 
 The main idea is to learn how to play available online hacking games (just get better in it) and learn hacking :-)  
 We group with some fanatic people so we can learn from each other. The challenges are facilitated by Bram, who works as a security software engineer. 

Expect an evening with other people playing hacking games both easy and moderate. 

We help each other. Bring your laptop and good mood. 

<h2>Program</h2>
- 19:00 doors open
- 19:30 starting with the hacking challenges!
- 21:30 open space: sharing projects and discussions, also: a price for the best hacker of the evening. 
- 22:45 closing
