<h1>Workshop - Flutter and Firebase (2019-09-18)</h1>

Tonight we have a workshop on 2 very powerful technologies: Flutter and Firebase. 

Register via mail towards [info@madspace.nl](info@madspace.nl) or via our [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/MADspace/). 

_Flutter_ is an app SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity apps for iOS, Android, and web (early access) from a single codebase.
_Firebase_ is a mobile and web application development platform, with over 18 cloud products, used by over 1.5 million apps (end 2018). 

We at MADspace had a great time on last Flutter evening [08/21](https://www.madspace.nl/2019/08/21/Aankondiging_FlutterIntroNight.html). 
 Wednesday 11 september is the sequence: in a 2 hour during workshop we will develop flutter applications with a Firebase backend.
